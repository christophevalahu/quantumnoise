# Quantum Noise

This package offers solutions to analyze various noise sources and their effects on the decoherence of a qubit. 

Documentation can be found [here](https://quantumnoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

TODO : 
 - Add documentation for equations + sources
 - Add CCW current noise couplings
